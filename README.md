# Linear Regression

* We built a linear regression model from scratch.
* We used the mean square loss and gradient descent.
* We used the [students scores dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubham47/students-score-dataset-linear-regression/data) from kaggle.

Before running the main.py file, we need to first:
1. create a virtual environment
   - Install the virtual environment: pip install virtualenv
   - create a new project folder, cd to the project folder, and then run: python -m <your-virtual-env-name>
   - activate your virtual environment: source <your-virtual-env-name>/bin/activate
2. Second create a requirements.txt file
   - type the names of the libraries you will need to be installed for the project, e.g. pandas, scikit-learn, etc.
   - save it, then run: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the main.py
4. To deactivate the virtual environment, run: deactivate
